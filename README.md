## Recipe AI - Ingredient Classifier and Recipe Recommender

### Overview

Recipe AI is a web application that uses deep learning to classify food ingredients from images and then recommends recipes based on the detected ingredients. The app integrates a pre-trained MobileNet model for ingredient recognition and a nearest neighbors search on a recipe dataset to find similar recipes.

Built with Streamlit, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn, this project offers an intuitive interface for users to upload photos of ingredients and get personalized recipe suggestions instantly.
